      "Project Name": "A Detailed Assessment of Salmon Habitat in the Skeena River Estuary",
      "Project Lead Organization": "Pacific Salmon Foundation",
      "Project Description": "This project directly supports the implementation of Strategy Two of Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy in the Skeena watershed. Focusing on the Skeena river estuary, this project will document estuarine habitat characteristics for all five species of Pacific salmon. The Skeena estuary is part of the Chatham Sound Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area located near Prince Rupert, on the north-central coast of British Columbia. Estuaries provide critical habitats for all species of Pacific salmon during the physiologically challenging transition between fresh and salt water. Yet, despite their importance, we have a limited understanding of the locations of high value salmon habitat in the Skeena estuary and their vulnerability to cumulative threats and pressures. This project will improve our understanding of, and identify potential threats to, the status of salmon habitat in the Skeena estuary. Indicators, benchmarks, and a collaborative monitoring framework will be developed to assess the status of salmon habitat over time, and will reflect existing stewardship initiatives and regional monitoring priorities. A unique feature of this project is the establishment of a multi-sectoral Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) to provide regional expertise and guidance throughout the duration of the project, including local First Nations, eNGOs, academic researchers, provincial and federal governments, the Prince Rupert Port Authority, and others. The TAC will play a critical role in informing the design of future stewardship activities in the watershed and identifying areas of high value and degraded habitat – i.e. areas in need of protection and restoration. A TAC is an effective medium for engaging Canadians in the conservation of salmon populations and their habitat and creating active stewards in the watershed.",

In partnership with others (e.g. DFO, District of North Vancouver, Metro Vancouver, Seymour Salmonid Society, Tsleil-Waututh Nation) a five year program has been implemented to restore fish passage through the slide debris by blasting and natural fluvial processes, with trapping, trucking and radio telemetry tracking to ensure survival of the coho and steelhead populations until the plan to re-establish fish passage through the barrier is complete.",
